# SlimBarsFirefox

[Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) [userChrome.css file](https://www.userchrome.org/) that reduces the tab and navigation bar heights to increase available screen space. The thin bars have their buttons' and input fields' Tab selection highlight outline replaced by a browser accent color based background highlight.



## Install

#### Manual

1. Visit [about:config](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/about-config-editor-firefox), search for toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets and double-click to make it "true".

2. Copy or append the contents of the userChrome.css file (in)to [your Firefox profile]/chrome/userChrome.css. (Open your profile directory by visiting [about:profiles](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-remove-switch-firefox-profiles) and clicking on the "Open Directory" button within the "Root Directory" row in the profile tagged "This is the profile in use and it cannot be deleted".)


#### Scripted

Run the .sh file if on a Unix-like (Linux, Mac and others), or the .bat file (creation pending upon demand) if on Windows (usually by double-clicking) to have the manual install process performed automatically.

Given the simplicity in the install scripts the manual process is recommended if there are multiple Firefox installations in use.
